# APK Malware Analyzer 🕵️‍♂️💻

## 🚨 Overview 🚨

**APK Malware Analyzer** is a powerful, fast, and easy-to-use tool designed to perform static analysis on Android APK files. It helps security researchers, app developers, and enthusiasts detect potential malware or suspicious behavior hidden in APKs. This tool leverages common malware detection techniques to provide detailed reports on risks, suspicious code patterns, permissions, and encoded payloads.

### ⚠️ **Disclaimer** ⚠️
Please note that **APK Malware Analyzer** does **not guarantee 100% detection of malware**, especially with **obfuscated APKs**. Advanced obfuscation and evasion techniques used in malware may alter the APK’s code or data, making it difficult to detect using static analysis. The tool is based on known patterns and heuristics, which may not catch every possible malware variant.

## 🔥 Features 🔥

- **APK Extraction**: Extracts APK contents and decodes the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for permission analysis.
- **Manifest Permission Analysis**: Scans for suspicious permissions that may indicate potentially dangerous behavior, like internet access, SMS reading/sending, or camera usage.
- **Pattern Matching**: Scans DEX files for known malware patterns, network operations, dynamic code loading, and crypto operations.
- **Encoded Payload Detection**: Detects potentially malicious Base64-encoded payloads hiding in the DEX files.
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates an overall risk score based on detected suspicious activities and patterns.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates a Markdown report summarizing the findings with detailed insights.


### 💻 Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (Yes, Python is your friend)
- `androguard` (APK analysis magic 🔮)
- `rich` (Beautiful terminal output 🖥️)
- `zipfile` and `base64` (For extraction and encoding detection)
